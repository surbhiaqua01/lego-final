# lego-analysis 

Description:
This dataset contains information on LEGO sets released over multiple years, including pricing, piece counts, themes, age groups, packaging, and design features such as minifigures and unique pieces. Each row represents a single LEGO set and captures both product characteristics and retail pricing data, including Amazon prices.

The purpose of this dataset is to analyze LEGO’s product and pricing strategies across different themes, sizes, and target age groups. By examining relationships between price, complexity, and set attributes, the dataset helps evaluate value for money, identify pricing patterns, and explore how LEGO differentiates products over time.

Overall, the dataset is intended for exploratory analysis and insight generation around product design, consumer targeting, and market behavior within the LEGO product lineup.

# Questions of interest

1. How has the average price of sets changed over production years — i.e., are newer sets more expensive (or have more pieces) than older ones?
2. Are sets for older kids priced differently than those for younger kids?
3. Which LEGO themes have the lowest average price per piece?
4. Do sets with more pieces cost less per piece?
5. How do Small, Medium, and Large sets differ in price and piece count?

The answers are determining from the mentioned data set by extracting the information, transforming it into the necessary form, table and displaying the visualization.
